<h1 align="center">Heart Failure Visualisation</h1>

_Heart failure is a chronic condition and with the high increasing rate of heart diseases it becomes immensely important for us to properly understand the disease and combat it. The primary idea of the project is to identify the best classifier algorithm suitable for this task._

> The main objective of the project is to analyze different classifier models to provide early detection or prediction of heart failure for people suffering from cardiovascular diseases.

<br>

1. Detailed **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** to uncover different features of the dataset to give an elaborate understanding of the data.

2. Compute correlation among different attributes of the dataset. The efficiency of the model is increased by using **StandardScaler** & **SMOTE**.

3. Feature selection based on coherence with target attribute by application of techniques like **Correlation matrix heatmap**, **Chi-square test**, **Random Forest classifier**, **Extra Trees classifier**.

4. Prediction of target attribute by different types of algorithms, namely **Logistic Regression**, **SVM**, **KNN**, **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosting**, **XGBM**, **XGBRF**, **LightGBM**, **CatBoost** and **ANN**.

5. Evaluation of performance of different algorithms by metrics like **confusion matrix**, **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall** and **F1 score**.

- The project is developed in `Python` on Jupyter Notebook.

- The dataset has been collected from [Heart Failure Clinical Records](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data "Kaggle") dataset on `Kaggle`.
